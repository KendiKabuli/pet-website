# pet-website
This is a simple pet website built using html, css and javascript, it is designed as a single page website where all the content is divided into sections that you scroll through vertically rather than multiple separate html pages


The website showcases different sections such as

- Home, About, Services, Store and Contacts

However, the navigation links or buttons on the website are currently non-functional as i am still learning how to make them work using javascript

I have used

- HTML - For page structure
- CSS - For styling and layout
- Javascript - For small interactive features like scrolling

I am still working on: 
- Adding functionality to buttons and navigation
- Improving responsiveness across devices
- Adding more animations and interactivity with javascript

This project is part of my web development learning journey.  
Iâ€™m using it to practice:
- Structuring a one-page website  
- Styling with CSS  
- Slowly learning JavaScript to make it more interactive  

This website is a personal learning project, created out of love for animals and curiosity for web design
